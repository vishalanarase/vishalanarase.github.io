## Introduction

Modern distributed applications rely on dozens of services, APIs, and external integrations. Traditional monitoring tools like Prometheus or Datadog detect when something is wrong after it happens, but wouldnâ€™t it be better to proactively verify that your systems and integrations are working as expected

This is where Canary Checker comes in. It is a Kubernetes native health check platform designed to continuously validate services, infrastructure, and integrations through proactive canaries. Think of it as automated tests running inside your cluster, validating not only pods, but also databases, APIs, and external SaaS services.

## What is Canary Checker

Canary Checker is a declarative health check system for Kubernetes, built to ensure your workloads and dependencies behave as expected.

* Runs synthetic, passive, infrastructure, and integration checks inside Kubernetes.
* Provides a unified dashboard and Prometheus metrics for observability.
* Designed for GitOps workflows, you define canary CRDs alongside other manifests.

Unlike simple readiness/liveness probes, Canary Checker validates end-to-end functionality across your entire stack.
