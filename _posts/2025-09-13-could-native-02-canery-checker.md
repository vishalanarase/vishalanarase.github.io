## Introduction

Modern distributed applications rely on dozens of services, APIs, and external integrations. Traditional monitoring tools like Prometheus or Datadog detect when something is wrong after it happens, but wouldnâ€™t it be better to proactively verify that your systems and integrations are working as expected

This is where Canary Checker comes in. It is a Kubernetes native health check platform designed to continuously validate services, infrastructure, and integrations through proactive canaries. Think of it as automated tests running inside your cluster, validating not only pods, but also databases, APIs, and external SaaS services.
